# watering_node

A simple arduino pro mini based watering automation system meant for one plant. Can act alone with programed parameters, but is also a I2c Slave through which parameters can be set and data can be streamed.

Includes:
* Soil Moisture Sensor
* DHT11
* i2c slave to send data some way of visualization 
* A 6V perestaltic pump to water the plant

Will posssibly maybe include sometime in the future:
* RTC to have a scheduled watering time
* A fan to locally reduce air moisture
* A PH meter to measure water PH

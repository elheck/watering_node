A simple arduino pro mini based watering automation system meant for one plant.

Includes:
* A 20 pulse rotary encoder with switch to control the settings
* Soil Moisture Sensor
* DHT11
* Oled to show current measurements
* A 6V perestaltic pump to water the plant

Will posssibly maybe include sometime in the future:
* RTC to have a scheduled watering time
